# General Assembly's Learning Philosophy

## Putting Real Skills to Work

The world is moving the fastest it ever has.

And skills are somehow evolving even faster.

At General Assembly, we understand how difficult it is for individuals and businesses alike to keep up with emerging technologies and the constant evolution of roles. The skills and tools needed to succeed in these roles are constantly changing. It can feel overwhelming for everyone—especially those early in their careers, contemplating new paths, or advancing in nontraditional ways—as well as for businesses inside and outside of the tech space.

Today's workforce, regardless of industry, is increasingly fueled by tech skills that are becoming even more valuable as the digitally charged future of work, and all things AI, become more commonplace.

We've spent the last 13 years working with employers, tech experts, and industry insiders to build a learning ecosystem that helps everyone thrive in a digital-first world. This ecosystem empowers efficient talent, skill, and process transformation and breaks down barriers for underrepresented and historically marginalized groups, particularly in tech.

Over 100,000 students have gained skills and confidence through our programs. We believe that anyone can learn technical and workplace skills with the right experience, support, and community—and everyone should have the opportunity to improve their lives through learning.

**All the best,**

## Engage

### Captivate and Encourage
Learning happens best when it focuses on the most essential knowledge, connects to real-life relevance, and keeps learners motivated.

### Focus on the Objectives
Learning should concentrate on core content, activities, and assessments that align with objectives while minimizing distractions and extraneous content.

### Give Learning Content the Spotlight
User experience matters. Learning platforms and materials should be intuitive and focused, enabling easier understanding with purposeful navigation and visuals.

### Keep Learners Going
Motivate learners by making personal connections and showing relevance to their lives and jobs. Use real-world examples, case studies, and relatable stories.

### Promote a Growth Mindset
Learning should reinforce that skills can improve with practice. Learners need to hear and believe that improvement is always possible.

### Be Flexible
Learning must fit into diverse lifestyles, whether learners are students, professionals, caregivers, or all of the above. Design should support remote and blended learning.

### Activate Remote Learning
Remote and blended models often outperform traditional ones. Benefits include:
- More time for practice
- Greater personalization and feedback
- Flexibility in schedule and learning style
- Integrated experiences across formats

## Prepare

### Focus on Real-World Application
Learning should emphasize doing, not just knowing. Learners must be equipped to apply skills on the job.

### Incorporate Realistic Practice
Design learning to mimic real-world tasks, with contextual scenarios, practical exercises, and job-aligned challenges.

### Model and Explain a Variety of Scenarios
Expose learners to complex, varied problems and demonstrate how to solve them. Provide reasoning behind each step and explore different solution paths.

### Make Routine Tasks Second Nature
Use repetition and procedural learning to automate routine tasks. Enable learners to internalize processes.

### Support Complex Problem-Solving
For non-routine tasks, provide varied examples and theoretical support. Emphasize critical thinking, reasoning, and adaptability.

### Build Independence
Enable learners to perform independently, make decisions, and reflect on performance.

#### Encourage Self-Regulated Learning
Support planning, goal-setting, monitoring progress, and self-reflection.

#### Allow Choice and Control
Give learners autonomy over pacing, content order, and focus areas to support motivation and self-directed progress.

#### Promote Independent Practice
Encourage learners to solve problems before seeking help. Practice resilience and persistence to build job-readiness.

---

## Support

### Emphasize Feedback
Feedback should be specific, individualized, timely, and actionable. It helps learners understand mistakes, improve performance, and self-monitor.

### Provide Scaffolding Through Coaching
Use coaching and scaffolding to move learners from supported to independent performance. Scaffolding strategies include:
- Simplifying tasks
- Managing processes
- Reducing frustration
- Prompting reflection

### Be Social
Collaboration enhances learning, simulates real work environments, and supports social connection.

#### Enable Collaborative Learning
Encourage peer feedback, conversation, and real-audience work. Social learning fosters engagement and deeper understanding.

#### Use Collaborative Learning Strategically
Social learning works best when foundational skills are already in place. Use it for open-ended tasks, discussions, and complex problem-solving.
