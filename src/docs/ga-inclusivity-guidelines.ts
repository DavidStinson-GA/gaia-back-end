# GA Inclusivity Guidelines

**GA’s mission is to enable people to pursue the work they love.**  
Implicit in that mission is opening career paths to individuals underserved by broader education and employment systems—especially people of color and women pursuing lucrative tech careers historically dominated by white men.

Media and cultural stereotypes contribute to this imbalance. For example, the persistent image of the upper-middle-class white male as the "typical programmer" affects both who chooses to enter the field and how those who don’t match that image are treated.

**GA can help shift these perceptions by affirming that everyone belongs in tech.**

## Inclusivity Checklist

### ✅ Representation Matters. Lead with Diversity.

Pending a GA-wide definition, **diversity** includes:

- Race  
- Ethnic identity and country of origin  
- Gender, gender identity, and sexuality  
- Socioeconomic status and class  
- Ability  
- Age  
- Affinities, interests, and hobbies  

**Our curriculum should be human and relatable. Use:**

- Real quotes from thought leaders  
- Real business examples and case studies  
- Fictional companies and realistic scenarios  
- Analogies  
- Memes, GIFs, and light humor  

**Checklist:**

- Avoid only using white, gendered names like "John Doe" or "Jane Smith"  
- Use a name generator to create diverse character names  
- Ensure visible diversity in videos, photos, and graphics  
- Feature quotes from Black, Brown, and women thought leaders  
- Use case studies from minority- and women-owned businesses  
- Cast actors and interviewees from diverse backgrounds across lessons

### ✅ Avoid Gendered Language and Stereotypes

Gender bias often shows up in subtle ways. We must actively look for and remove it.

**Examples:**

- ❌ “manKind”  
- ✅ “humanKind”

**Checklist:**

- Use gendered terms only when referring to someone who identifies that way  
- Avoid stereotypical associations (e.g., lipstick for “vanity metrics”)  
- Alternate use of “he,” “she,” and “they” when describing characters  

---

### ✅ Avoid Regionally-Specific Analogies and References

We're a global company. American-centric content may alienate non-U.S. learners.

**Examples:**

- ❌ Football team analogies  
- ✅ Restaurant analogy with globally relevant KPIs

**Checklist:**

- Replace analogies specific to one culture or location  
- Avoid defaulting to U.S. cities/landmarks  
- Use globally recognized brands (e.g., Coca-Cola instead of Tab)  
- Use international currencies where appropriate (Euros, Pounds, etc.)  

---

### ✅ Be Careful with Idioms and Turns-of-Phrase

**Examples:**

- ❌ “Scrub your database of dirty data”  
- ✅ “Remove incorrect or corrupt data from your database”

**Checklist:**

- Avoid idioms and slang  
- Define jargon clearly and early  
- Have a subject matter expert (SME) check translations  
- Use simple, direct language in knowledge checks  
- Avoid phrases like “killing it” or “crushed that project”

---

### ✅ Always Have Transcripts or Captions for Videos

Transcripts and captions:

- Help English language learners follow along  
- Are essential for learners with hearing disabilities  
- Improve comprehension for everyone  

---

### ✅ Avoid References to Pork, Beef, Dogs, Alcohol, and Sex

These references may conflict with religious or cultural beliefs. Avoid:

- Pigs / pork products  
- Beef  
- Dogs  
- Alcohol, drugs, partying  
- Sexual or romantic content  

> **Note:** If excluding these items compromises educational quality or values, consult HR.

---

### ✅ Provide Differentiation for In-Person Courses

Learners have different comfort levels with public speaking, creative thinking, and course content.

**Checklist:**

- Mix activity types: individual, pair, group  
- Provide clear instructions and structure  
- Offer templates and examples for presentations  
- Offer frameworks for creative tasks  
- Provide alternative icebreakers based on region  
- Include "basic" and "bonus" requirements for tasks  

---

### ✅ Use Case Studies from Everywhere

Don’t default to U.S.-centric examples.

**Checklist:**

- Use case studies from at least two countries or regions per lesson  
- Include alternative regional examples in speaker notes  
- Choose globally recognized U.S. brands if used
