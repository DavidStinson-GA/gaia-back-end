#Exercise Instruction Guidelines

> **Golden Rule:**  
> **"Don't make me think."**  
> When students are confused by the structure or operations of an exercise, they have less mental space to focus on the actual learning. Clear instructions help students learn and help instructors support students effectively.

Use the following guidelines when writing instructions for **solo, pair, or group exercises**.

## Must-Haves

### 1. **State the Purpose of the Exercise**
- Explain **why** students are doing this exercise.
- Clarify the intended **learning outcomes**.
- Connect it to previous or future class content.

### 2. **Clearly Explain the Deliverables**
- Define how students should **demonstrate completion**.
- Examples: take notes, complete a worksheet, share with the class, finish a coding task.

### 3. **Explain Each Student's Role**
- For **pairs or groups**, outline **individual responsibilities**.
- Clarify if different students have different tasks or outputs.

### 4. **Break Down the Steps**
- Use **bullets or numbered lists** instead of paragraph text.
- Ensure the **order of operations** is easy to follow.
- For multi-step activities, consider **one step per slide** for clarity.

### 5. **Use the Right Slide Template**
- Choose the template that best suits the **type and format** of the activity.
- Refer to the guidance deck for template suggestions.

### 6. **Check for Inclusivity**
- Use **clear, jargon-free language**.
- Ensure **visuals and references** are diverse and culturally appropriate.
- Design exercises to be relevant for a **global audience**.
- _[See inclusivity guidelines for more details.]_

### 7. **Adapt for Remote Learning**
- Avoid location-based phrases like:
  - "Turn to a partner"
  - "At your table"
- Keep instructions **location-neutral** on slides.
- Add remote-specific instructions in **instructor notes**.
- _[See remote classroom guidelines for more details.]_

## As Needed

### 1. **Share an Example of the Final Output**
- Provide a **sample deliverable** when possible.
- Helps students understand what a "good" result looks like.

### 2. **Assign a Group Speaker**
- If groups will present, remind them to **choose a speaker** to share out.
